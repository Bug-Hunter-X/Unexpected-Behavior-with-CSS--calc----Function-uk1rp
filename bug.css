The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there can be unexpected behavior when using `calc()` with units that are not compatible or when the calculation results in an invalid value.  For example, if you try to subtract a length from a percentage directly (e.g., `width: calc(100% - 20px);`), it's generally fine, but it can become problematic with more complex operations, especially across different units.

Another issue arises when dealing with nested `calc()` functions.  While they are allowed, excessive nesting can make the CSS difficult to read and debug and may lead to unexpected outcomes due to operator precedence and unit handling.

Finally, browser support for `calc()` can vary slightly across different versions and browsers.  Older browsers might not support all the features or might have subtle differences in how they interpret the calculations.
